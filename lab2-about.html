        for this assignment, the table helps show the difference between relative and absolute links.<br>
        It makes the links easier to understand and show the information is organized properly. Tables are useful.
        because they keep information neat and organized.<br>
        They also put details and other things side by side so the comparisons are easy to format and compare.
