    <h1>Welcome to my world!</h1>
    <p>Metadata is extra information about a webpage that allows a computer to understand it. People may not see it.
        In HTML, <q>!doctype html</q> tells a <strong>browser</strong> how modern the page is, and <q>html</q>is the
        main wrapper. In the
        <q>head</q> structure, <q>title</q> names the page tab in the browser, and meta tags add a short description for
        search engines.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Metadata also helps the page fit on phones, and make sure the text is showing correctly. Basically, metadata
        helps the page show up better and work online. <br>
        The <q>body</q> consists of the actual content.
